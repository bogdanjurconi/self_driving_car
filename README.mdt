# Self Driving Car

-This project is made on a 4tronit Initio.
-The car is able to follow a line using the infrared line sensors.
-The code allows the car to start when it detects a human face and it does stop when it detects a stop sign.
-The face and stop sign detection is realized using Haar Cascades.
